<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a delicous pasta called regatonni-alavadka made at home!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb rigatoni pasta</li>
  <li>1‚Äì2 tbsp olive oil</li>
   <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
   <li>1 small yellow onion or 2 shallots, minced</li>
   <li> 3‚Äì4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li> ¬Ω cup tomato paste</li>
    <li> ¬Ω tsp red pepper flakes (or more, to taste)</li>
    <li> ¬Ω cup vodka</li>
    <li> 1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li> ¬Ω cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more for serving</li>
    <li> Fresh basil leaves, for garnish</li>
    <li> Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni and cook until it is 1 minute shy of al dente, according to package directions. Before draining, reserve at least 1 cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
  <li>Saut√© the aromatics. While the pasta cooks, melt the butter with the olive oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the minced onion or shallots and cook until softened and translucent, about 5‚Äì7 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
  <li>Caramelize the tomato paste. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 3‚Äì5 minutes, stirring frequently, until it deepens in color to a dark red or rust. This step removes the raw, metallic taste and adds a richer flavor.</li>
  <li>Add the vodka. Pour in the vodka and stir well, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan to deglaze it. Let it simmer for 1‚Äì2 minutes to allow the alcohol to cook off.</li>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a delicous pasta bolognese at home recipe</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
   <li>4 oz pancetta,finely chopped</li>
   <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
   <li>1 large carrot, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 large celery stalk, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 lb ground beef (85% lean)</li>
    <li>1/2 lb ground pork</li>
    <li>1 cup dry white wine or red wine</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp freshly grated nutmeg</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 lb fresh tagliatelle or other pasta</li>
    <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese, for serving </li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Saut√© the pancetta: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring frequently, until golden and crisp.</li>
  <li>Cook the soffritto: Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery. Cook until the vegetables have softened and the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Brown the meat: Increase the heat and add the ground beef and pork. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon and cook until it is no longer pink and is well-browned. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
  <li>Deglaze with wine: Pour in the wine and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Simmer with milk: Add the milk and nutmeg. Bring to a simmer and cook until the milk has almost completely evaporated and been absorbed by the meat, about 30‚Äì45 minutes.</li>
<li>Add tomatoes: Stir in the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste, mixing thoroughly to combine. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Slow simmer: Bring the sauce to a gentle bubble, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Partially cover the pot, leaving the lid ajar. Simmer for at least 1.5 hours, but ideally for 2‚Äì3 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the richer the flavor will be. If the sauce becomes too dry, add a little broth or water.</li>
<li>Cook the pasta: About 15 minutes before the sauce is finished, cook the pasta in a large pot of generously salted boiling water according to the package directions, until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
<li>Combine and serve: Add the drained pasta directly to the pot with the bolognese sauce. Add a splash of the reserved pasta water and toss to combine, allowing the pasta to absorb the sauce. Serve immediately, topped with plenty of grated parmesan cheese.</li>

 <h2>üçùchicken parm pasta</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is an amazing reciepe for chicken parm and pasta all in one dish!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts or cutlets</li>
  <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
   <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
   <li>1 cup seasoned Italian breadcrumbs (or panko breadcrumbs)</li>
   <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>4 tbsp olive oil, for pan-frying</li>
    <li>12 oz short pasta (penne or rigatoni work well)</li>
    <li>24‚Äì32 oz marinara sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Fresh basil or parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare the chicken. Preheat your oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C). Create a dredging station with three shallow dishes: one with the flour, one with the beaten eggs, and one with the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces if not using pre-cut cutlets.</li>
  <li>Coat and pan-fry the chicken. Dredge each chicken piece first in the flour, then dip it into the egg, and finally coat it evenly in the breadcrumb mixture. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and pan-fry the chicken for 4‚Äì5 minutes per side, until golden and crispy. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
  <li>Cook the pasta. While the chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 2 minutes less than the package directions, or until al dente. This prevents the pasta from getting too soft while baking. Drain the pasta.</li>
  <li>Assemble the bake. In a large bowl, combine the drained pasta with the marinara sauce, 1/2 cup of the shredded mozzarella, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan. Toss to combine.</li>
  <li>Layer and bake. Transfer the pasta mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange the breaded chicken pieces evenly over the pasta. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
  <li>Bake and broil. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 20‚Äì25 minutes, or until the sauce is hot and bubbly. For a crispy, golden top, remove the foil and broil for 1‚Äì2 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning.</li>
  <li>Serve. Let the casserole rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
